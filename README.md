- In this project, it is used two datasets from the Bureau
of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to explore travel behaviour. The analysis aims to answer various questions
about trip patterns, including how different distance ranges relate to one another. It is conducted different
analyses in parallel, such as comparing weekly data and modelling trends through linear and polynomial
regression. The goal is not only to understand patterns but also to evaluate the predictive potential of the
data. The insights gained can also support more informed decisions around transportation planning and
forecasting in the U.S. context.
